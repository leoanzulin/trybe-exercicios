    <p>Getting born in the state of Mississippi
        Papa was a copper
        And mama was a hippie
        In Alabama
        She would swing a hammer
        Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
        
        She never knew
        That there was anything more than poor
        What in the world
        Does your company take me for?
        Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
        Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
        
        She’s a runner, rebel and a stunner
        On her merry way sayin’
        Baby, watcha gonna?
        Looking down the barrel
        Of a hot metal 45
        Just another way to survive
        
        California, rest in peace
        Simultaneous release
        California, show your teeth
        She’s my priestess, I'm your priest
        Yeah, yeah
        
        She’s a lover, baby, and a fighter
        Shoulda seen it comin’
        When it got a little brighter
        With a name like Dani California
        The day was gonna come
        When I was gonna mourn ya
        
        A little loaded
        She was stealin’ another breath
        I love my baby to death
        
        California, rest in peace
        Simultaneous release
        California, show your teeth
        She’s my priestess, I'm your priest
        Yeah, yeah
        
        Who knew the other side of you?
        Who knew what others died to prove?
        Too true to say goodbye to you
        Too true to say, say, say
        
        Push the fader
        Gifted animator
        One for the now
        And eleven for the later
        Never made it up to Minnesota
        North Dakota man
        Was a gunnin' for the quota
        
        Down in the badlands
        She was savin’ the best for last
        It only hurts when I laugh
        Gone too fast
        
        California, rest in peace
        Simultaneous release
        California, show your teeth
        She’s my priestess, I'm your priest
        Yeah, yeah
        
        California, rest in peace
        Simultaneous release
        California, show your teeth
        She’s my priestess, I'm your priest
        Yeah, yeah</p>
